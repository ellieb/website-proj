        Melville began writing Moby-Dick in February 1850, and would eventually
        take 18 months to write the book, a full year more than he had first
        anticipated. Writing was interrupted by his making the acquaintance of
        Nathaniel Hawthorne in August 1850, and by the creation of the "Mosses
        from an Old Manse" essay as a first result of that friendship. The book
        is dedicated to Hawthorne, "in token of my admiration for his genius".
        The basis for the work is Melville's 1841 whaling voyage aboard the
        Acushnet. The novel also draws on whaling literature, and on literary
        inspirations such as Shakespeare and the Bible. The white whale is
        modeled on the notoriously hard-to-catch albino whale Mocha Dick, and
        the book's ending is based on the sinking of the whaleship Essex in
        1820. The detailed and realistic descriptions of whale hunting and of
        extracting whale oil, as well as life aboard ship among a culturally
        diverse crew, are mixed with exploration of class and social status,
        good and evil, and the existence of God. In addition to narrative prose,
        Melville uses styles and literary devices ranging from songs, poetry,
        and catalogs to Shakespearean stage directions, soliloquies, and asides.
        In October 1851, the chapter "The Town Ho's Story" was published in
        Harper's New Monthly Magazine. The same month, the whole book was first
        published (in three volumes) as The Whale in London, and under its
        definitive title in a single-volume edition in New York in November.
        There are hundreds of differences between the two editions, most slight
        but some important and illuminating. The London publisher, Richard
        Bentley, censored or changed sensitive passages; Melville made revisions
        as well, including a last-minute change to the title for the New York
        edition. The whale, however, appears in the text of both editions as
        "Moby Dick", without the hyphen.[4] One factor that led British
        reviewers to scorn the book was that it seemed to be told by a narrator
        who perished with the ship: the British edition lacked the Epilogue,
        which recounts Ishmael's survival. About 3,200 copies were sold during
        the author's life.
